Please help me test the authentication system with automatic token management. 

Use the auth-mcp tools to:

1. Sign in with these credentials:
   - Email: irfan@mailinator.com
   - Password: Muh@mm@d9091

2. After signing in successfully, get my user profile using the get_api_auth_me tool

3. Show me both responses in a clear, formatted way

The server should automatically store the authentication token after step 1 and use it for step 2 without me having to provide it again. This tests the new automatic token management feature.

If there are any errors, please show me the exact error message so I can understand what went wrong.
