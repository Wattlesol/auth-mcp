IMPORTANT: First, restart the MCP connection in Qwen to load the latest tools!

Then use this prompt:

---

Please test the authentication system using these exact tool names:

Step 1: Sign in using the tool named "post_api_auth_signin" with these parameters:
- email: sxain123@gmail.com
- password: Muh@mm@d9091

Step 2: After successful signin, use the tool named "get_api_auth_me" with no parameters to get my user profile.

The token from step 1 should automatically persist and be used in step 2.

Show me the results from both steps.
